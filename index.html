          CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.CSS stands for
          Cascading Style Sheets and CSS describes how HTML elements are to be
          displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.CSS saves a lot of work.
          It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

          JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
          implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
          more than just sit there and display static information for you to
          look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
          animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.

          widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is
          especially suited for web development and can be embedded into
          HTML.PHP files can contain text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP
          code.PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is returned to
          the browser as plain HTML.
